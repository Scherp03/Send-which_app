# Content

The files in schemas contain the schemas for what is in the title and contain some basic methods. So far, in app.js is a test suite to verify that things work.

## Done

Create a list for:

* users,
* bestsellers,
* orders,
* ingredients,
* time slots

## Things to do

Create the following methods:

* getByState() to get a list of orders based on their state
* getByStateAndTime() to get the list of open orders sorted by slot time, used by the cooks to get the orders to be done in the right order;
* create a way to add statistics automatically whenever a new sandwich is created;
